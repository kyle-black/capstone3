Proposal #1
Using pictures from pre-classified hotel room photographs I will make a multi class CNN to identify hotels based off of room photos in order to help human trafficking investigations.  I will also connect a ‘fake’ database of hotel locations and map the pictures in a city. This will be put into a flask app where I will demonstrate the algorithm be uploading a photo to the app.
